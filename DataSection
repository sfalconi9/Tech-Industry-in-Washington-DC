Data sources: For this analysis, I intend to use the information provided from the following sources:
Washington DC Economic Partnership Neighborhoods and DC Technology Companies.
Foursquare API to explore the several neighborhoods where tech firms have operations.
Neighborhoods in Washington DC, Wikipedia
Urban Institute Greater DC

The data will be used to analyze the information from the tech industry in the DC area. I intend to compare the housing and office rental space fees in the different neighborhoods to make recommendations of the best locations. The Foursquare location will be used to retrieve key information from the most populated wards in the city to showcase critical information relevant to the reader. Also, I want to showcase the metrics from the latest research reports about the tech industry in the city to reflect the potential that this areas has in the technology industry.
