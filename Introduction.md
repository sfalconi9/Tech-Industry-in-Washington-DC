# Tech-Industry-in-Washington-DC

The idea for this project: Exploring the tech industry in the Washington DC area by comparing the neighborhoods where tech startups and companies have operations while contrasting the reasons this area is a tech hub.

I live in Northern Virginia, an area located in the proximity of Washington DC, and includes counties from Virginia and Maryland bordering the District of Columbia. A great part of the population commute to DC to work daily, dealing with traffic, expensive parking, and crowded metro stations, among other issues. If you rather move to DC, housing can be quite expensive, depending on the neighborhood, in part because of the development projects that have raised the property prices, including office spaces rental fees. For this reason, many people and companied decided to look for opportunities in other cities where the expenses are considerable lower.However, every year the number of companies transferring operations from out of state to DC continues to grow, as well as the investment for entrepreneurial startups.

The tech industry is experiencing a revival in the nation's capital in recent years. A growing number of tech jobs with salaries above the national average, tech startups looking to employ local talent, and a pool of graduates from nationally ranked universities, are a few reasons why the tech industry has blossomed.
Washington DC, besides being the home for the Federal Government, is recognized for being ranked #3 tech city in the nation, the best startup hub in the US, #1 best U.S. tech city for women, and top 10 cities for diversity in STEM.

Target audience:
1.	Recent graduates starting a career and professional talent with years of experience looking to transfer jobs from another area or new opportunities with a high paying job in the area.
2.	Free Lancers interested in exploring a career in tech but are not familiar neither with the companies based nor the geography of the city.
3.	Established technology companies looking to set operations in the District.
